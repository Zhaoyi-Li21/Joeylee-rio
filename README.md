- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Li Zhaoyi.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently beyond interested in understanding & enhancing machine learning systems, especially when it comes to the following topics:
-   1): compositionality and disentanglement of representations learned by sota pre-trained language models;
-   2): generalization and robustness of learning systems (in distribution shift scenarios);
-   3): composiitonal generalization and interpreting complex reasoning capacity of (large) neural language models;
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently a graduate student pursuing my master(Mphil) degree at USTC, School of Computer Science. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me : lizhaoyi777@mail.ustc.edu.cn or joeylee2333@gmail.com, feel free to drop me an email if you want to discuss on the above topics with me :D
