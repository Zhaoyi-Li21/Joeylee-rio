- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Li Zhaoyi
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m beyond interested in machine learning systems, especially when it comes to the following topics:
- 1): compositionality and disentanglement of learned representations;
- 2): generalization and robustness in distribution shift scenarios;
- 3): composiitonal generalization and interpreting complex reasoning capacity of (large) neural language models;
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently a graduate student pursuing my master degree at USTC, School of Computer Science.
