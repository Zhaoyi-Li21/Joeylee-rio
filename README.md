- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Li Zhaoyi (Joey).
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in understanding & enhancing neural language systems, especially when it comes to the following topics:
-   1): inspecting the compositionality of knowledge/representations in the large pre-trained language models;
-   2): composiitonal generalization and complex compositional reasoning capacity of (large) neural language models;
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently a PhD student at University of Science and Technology of China and City University of Hong Kong, Department of Computer Science. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me : lizhaoyi777@mail.ustc.edu.cn or joeylee2333@gmail.com, feel free to drop me an email if you want to discuss on the above topics with me :D
